Welcome, to Brightly with this system you will be able to manage people, companies and buildings.

## Why Brightly?

Naming things can be hard, so for this project I used a random word generator and picked the 
first word that I liked. So I dub you Brightly!

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* Gender format selection
I decided to use the ISO/IEC 5218 standard [See it wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_5218)
..* 0 = not known,
..* 1 = male,
..* 2 = female,
..* 9 = not applicable
